# Jobly - Express Back-End

Jobly is a full stack application utilizing a React front-end with Bootstrap and normal CSS styling, and a RESTful Express back-end with a PostgreSQL database. The front-end repository is separate and available [here](https://github.com/alex-rutan/react-jobly-frontend). Users of the Jobly application can search for jobs and companies and apply to any open positions listed.

## Getting Started

* Run the server `node server.js`
* Run the tests `jest install`

## How it Works

The deployed application can be viewed and used [here](https://alex-rutan-jobly.surge.sh/).

Users of Jobly can do the following:

* Login, signup, and edit their profile
* Search for jobs or companies by name
* View company details and view the jobs available at that company
* Apply for jobs

## Acknowledgements

Jobly is a project built as part of Rithm School's curriculum. My partner for this back-end portion was [Grant Li](https://github.com/grantyli94). Although we constructed our own Express back-end, the deployed front-end uses a [back-end version](https://github.com/alex-rutan/express-jobly-backend) constructed by Rithm School instructors, so all students utilized the same back-end to ensure consistency and ease of reviewing and debugging.
